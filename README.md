# 🧠 100 DSA Problems in Python – Interview Master 100

Welcome to my journey of solving **100 curated Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems** from the [Interview Master 100](https://instabyte.io/p/interview-master-100) series on [Instabyte.io](https://instabyte.io), using **Python**.

This repository serves as a structured record of my problem-solving process and a resource for anyone interested in brushing up on DSA concepts through clean, readable Python code.

## 📌 About the Challenge

**Interview Master 100** is a premium set of 100 hand-picked problems designed to help individuals prepare for technical interviews, particularly for top tech companies. The problems are a mix of:

- 🧮 Arrays & Strings  
- 🔗 Linked Lists  
- 🧱 Stacks & Queues  
- 🌳 Trees & Graphs  
- 🔁 Recursion & Backtracking  
- 📦 Dynamic Programming  
- 💰 Greedy Algorithms  
- 🔍 Searching & Sorting  
- 🛞 Heaps, Tries, and more

Each problem offers an opportunity to master a different concept or technique crucial for coding interviews.
