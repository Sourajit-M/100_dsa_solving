# 🧠 100 DSA Problems in Python – Interview Master 100  

Welcome to my journey of solving **100 curated Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems** from the **[Interview Master 100](https://instabyte.io/p/interview-master-100)** series on [Instabyte.io](https://instabyte.io), implemented in **Python**.  

This repository documents my problem-solving process and serves as a resource for mastering DSA concepts through **clean, efficient, and well-commented Python code**.

## 📌 About the Challenge  

**Interview Master 100** is a premium collection of **100 hand-picked problems** designed to prepare you for technical interviews at top tech companies (FAANG, etc.). The problems cover:  

| Category                  | Key Concepts |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Arrays & Hashing**      | Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Prefix Sum |
| **Linked Lists**          | Reversal, Fast & Slow Pointers, Merging |
| **Stacks & Queues**       | Monotonic Stacks, BFS/DFS |
| **Trees & Graphs**        | Traversals, DP on Trees, Topological Sort |
| **Dynamic Programming**   | Knapsack, LCS, Matrix DP |
| **Greedy Algorithms**     | Interval Scheduling, Huffman Coding |
| **Advanced Topics**       | Tries, Heaps, Bit Manipulation |

Each problem is carefully selected to reinforce **patterns commonly tested in coding interviews**.
